Categorize the following into either shopping items or recipes but not both.  

Examples: 
- spinach | shopping item
- cake | shopping item
- toy car | shopping item
- salt | shopping item
- i want to bake a cake | recipe
- i want to make my own olive oil | recipe

Input:
-- BEGIN --
{{$input}}
-- END --

If something could be purchased from a grocery store or somewhere like Target, then it should be considered a shopping item.  
If you're not sure if the ask is for a recipe or shopping item, assume shopping item and do not provide a recipe.

Your response must be in this form:
{
   "comment",
   "recipes" : [
		{
			"recipe-name",
			"recipe-url",
			"recipe-description",
			"ingredients" : [
				{
					"name",
					"quantity"
				}
			],			
			"directions" : []
		}
   ],
   "shopping-items-query"
}

For each recipe, find the ingredients for a popular recipe and add the result to the recipes array.

The "directions" field should be an array of strings

shopping-items-query should be a fuzzy search lucene query for all the shopping items and ingredients for each recipe between -- BEGIN -- and -- END --.

Say something funny about the ask in between -- BEGIN -- and -- END -- in the "comment" field.
