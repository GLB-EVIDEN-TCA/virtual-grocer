For each item in the input, classify it as a shopping-list-item or a recipe. Examples:
I want a chocolate cake | shopping-list-item
I want oil | shopping-list-item
I'd like a chocolate cake | shopping-list-item
I want to make chocolate cake | recipe
I want to bake a chocolate cake | recipe
I'd like to make my own chocolate cake | recipe
I need some milk | shopping-list-item
I need chocolate cake | shopping-list-item
I want to buy salsa | shopping-list-item
I want pre made chocolate cake | shopping-list-item
I want cookies from the bakery | shopping-list-item

If nothing at all in the input can be classified as a shopping-list-item, recipe, or something you would buy at a grocery store, say something humorous in response to the input, then say you're sorry this is a grocery store.  But, if at least one thing in the input can be classified, then it is OK.

For a recipe, find the ingredients for the a popular recipe for that item and show the result as a JSON object with the following properties:
- RecipeName
- RecipeUrl
- RecipeDescription
- Ingredients
  - Name
  - Quantity
- Directions

Note, the Directions should be an array.

For a shopping-list-item, show the result as a JSON object with the following properties:
- Name

All results should be returned in a JSON array.
